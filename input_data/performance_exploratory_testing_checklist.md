# Performance & Exploratory Testing Checklist

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the checklist for conducting performance and exploratory testing on the system. Performance testing ensures the system meets the required benchmarks under various load conditions, while exploratory testing provides an opportunity to investigate areas of the system that may not have been covered by formal test cases.

## 2. Performance Testing Checklist
The performance testing checklist is designed to ensure that the system performs optimally under expected and peak load conditions.

### 2.1 Performance Testing Environment
- [ ] Verify that the performance testing environment is properly set up and mirrors the production environment.
- [ ] Ensure load testing tools (e.g., JMeter, Gatling) are configured correctly.
- [ ] Confirm database and backend systems are included in the testing scope.

### 2.2 System Performance Metrics
- [ ] Response time for critical operations (e.g., login, data retrieval) under normal load.
- [ ] Response time for critical operations under peak load.
- [ ] Throughput rate (transactions per second).
- [ ] Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, and network usage) under various load levels.
- [ ] Database performance (query response time, transactions per second).
- [ ] API response times for key endpoints.
- [ ] Load balancing and server failover behavior.

### 2.3 Load and Stress Testing
- [ ] Simulate normal user load and observe system behavior.
- [ ] Gradually increase the load to the system's expected peak usage.
- [ ] Apply a stress load beyond the system’s capacity to test recovery mechanisms.
- [ ] Test system response with varying loads (e.g., morning vs. evening traffic patterns).
- [ ] Ensure that stress testing does not cause permanent system failure.

### 2.4 Scalability Testing
- [ ] Evaluate system scalability by simulating a 10x increase in user base.
- [ ] Monitor system resource usage (CPU, memory) under increased load.
- [ ] Check database performance when handling a significant increase in transactions.
- [ ] Verify that the system can scale horizontally (adding more servers) without performance degradation.

## 3. Exploratory Testing Checklist
Exploratory testing focuses on areas not explicitly defined by formal test cases, allowing testers to creatively explore the system for hidden issues.

### 3.1 Test Preparation
- [ ] Review existing test cases to identify gaps in the functional and non-functional coverage.
- [ ] Ensure that the exploratory testing scope includes all critical areas of the system.
- [ ] Prepare testing tools such as browser developer tools, logging utilities, and performance monitors.

### 3.2 Functional Exploratory Testing
- [ ] Explore system functionality by performing tasks as an end user.
- [ ] Investigate edge cases and invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect username/password during login).
- [ ] Test complex workflows that involve multiple steps (e.g., user registration and account management).
- [ ] Explore unplanned use of the system's features (e.g., chaining of features, unexpected inputs).
- [ ] Ensure that no hidden functionality or defects are present.

### 3.3 UI and Usability Exploration
- [ ] Navigate through different screens of the application to verify the consistency of UI elements.
- [ ] Verify the responsiveness of the application across different devices and screen sizes.
- [ ] Test for visual glitches and inconsistencies in the design, fonts, and colors.
- [ ] Check the application’s behavior in various browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- [ ] Verify the usability of the system by performing common tasks such as form submission, page navigation, and error handling.
- [ ] Test the accessibility features (e.g., screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast).

### 3.4 Security & Error Handling Exploration
- [ ] Perform security testing by attempting SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Test the system's error-handling capabilities by deliberately causing errors (e.g., submitting invalid data, using malformed requests).
- [ ] Verify that error messages provide adequate information without exposing sensitive data.
- [ ] Ensure that the application properly handles unexpected scenarios, such as network interruptions or database failures.

### 3.5 Performance Exploration
- [ ] Identify and investigate performance bottlenecks by simulating real-world usage scenarios.
- [ ] Test the system's response when performing multiple simultaneous operations (e.g., simultaneous user logins).
- [ ] Check for any noticeable delays in the user interface (UI) or interactions during heavy load.
- [ ] Investigate the system’s performance when operating with large data sets.

### 3.6 Bug Identification and Reporting
- [ ] Log any discovered bugs with detailed steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant screenshots.
- [ ] Prioritize discovered bugs based on severity and potential impact on users.
- [ ] Ensure exploratory testing sessions are time-boxed to focus on critical areas.

## 4. Post-Testing Activities
- [ ] Review all performance metrics and exploratory testing findings with the team.
- [ ] Generate performance test reports detailing any performance issues or scalability concerns.
- [ ] Discuss exploratory testing results with developers and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
- [ ] Retest any critical issues discovered during the exploratory testing sessions.

## 5. Conclusion
This checklist is designed to ensure comprehensive coverage of both performance and exploratory testing for the application. By following this checklist, testers can uncover potential system issues that may not be detected through traditional testing methods.
