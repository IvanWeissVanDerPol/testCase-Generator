# Test Case Overview & Integration

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the test cases related to various components and their integration within the system. It outlines the structure for functional and non-functional test cases and explains how different system components are tested together to ensure seamless integration.

## 2. Objectives
The objectives of this document are:
- To provide an overview of the test cases designed for both functional and non-functional aspects of the system.
- To ensure that the test cases cover key functionalities like login, registration, and error handling.
- To document the integration between different system components (e.g., frontend and backend, APIs, and database).
- To map each test case to specific requirements and components.

## 3. Functional Test Case Overview
Functional test cases are designed to validate the core functionalities of the system. This includes testing individual features and components to ensure they meet the specified requirements.

### 3.1 Login Functionality
- **Test Case ID**: TC_LOGIN_001
- **Test Scenario**: Verify that a user can log in with valid credentials.
- **Preconditions**: User must have a valid account.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Open the login page.
  2. Enter valid credentials (email and password).
  3. Click the "Login" button.
- **Expected Results**: User is logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

- **Test Case ID**: TC_LOGIN_002
- **Test Scenario**: Verify that the system displays an error for invalid credentials.
- **Preconditions**: User account exists but incorrect credentials are entered.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Open the login page.
  2. Enter invalid credentials (incorrect email or password).
  3. Click the "Login" button.
- **Expected Results**: Error message is displayed indicating invalid credentials.

### 3.2 Registration Functionality
- **Test Case ID**: TC_REG_001
- **Test Scenario**: Verify that a new user can register successfully.
- **Preconditions**: User must provide valid information (name, email, password).
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Open the registration page.
  2. Fill in the required fields (name, email, password).
  3. Click the "Register" button.
- **Expected Results**: A new user account is created, and the user is redirected to the dashboard.

- **Test Case ID**: TC_REG_002
- **Test Scenario**: Verify that the system displays an error for invalid registration details.
- **Preconditions**: User provides incomplete or invalid details.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Open the registration page.
  2. Enter incomplete or invalid details (missing required fields, weak password).
  3. Click the "Register" button.
- **Expected Results**: Error message is displayed indicating the validation failure.

### 3.3 Error Handling
- **Test Case ID**: TC_ERR_001
- **Test Scenario**: Verify that the system handles server errors gracefully.
- **Preconditions**: Simulate a server error by making the backend service unavailable.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Perform an action that requires server communication (e.g., login, data retrieval).
- **Expected Results**: A user-friendly error message is displayed, and the system remains operational.

## 4. Non-Functional Test Case Overview
Non-functional test cases validate the system’s performance, security, usability, and other quality attributes that ensure the system’s robustness.

### 4.1 Performance Testing
- **Test Case ID**: TC_PERF_001
- **Test Scenario**: Measure system response time under normal load.
- **Preconditions**: The system should be operating under expected user load.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Simulate normal load (e.g., 500 users concurrently accessing the system).
  2. Measure response time for login and data retrieval.
- **Expected Results**: Response times should not exceed 2 seconds under normal load conditions.

### 4.2 Security Testing
- **Test Case ID**: TC_SEC_001
- **Test Scenario**: Verify that unauthorized access to restricted areas is prevented.
- **Preconditions**: User does not have administrative privileges.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Attempt to access restricted areas (e.g., admin dashboard) using a non-admin account.
- **Expected Results**: Access is denied, and the user is redirected to the login page.

### 4.3 Usability Testing
- **Test Case ID**: TC_USA_001
- **Test Scenario**: Assess the ease of use of the registration process.
- **Preconditions**: User interacts with the registration form.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the registration page.
  2. Complete the form and submit.
  3. Evaluate the time and steps required to complete registration.
- **Expected Results**: The registration process is intuitive, and no more than 3 steps are required.

## 5. Integration Testing
Integration test cases validate that individual system components work together as expected, ensuring seamless communication between frontend, backend, and external APIs.

### 5.1 Frontend and Backend Integration
- **Test Case ID**: TC_INTEGRATION_001
- **Test Scenario**: Verify that login data entered in the frontend is correctly processed by the backend.
- **Preconditions**: User attempts to log in with valid credentials.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Open the login page.
  2. Enter valid credentials.
  3. Submit the form.
- **Expected Results**: The backend authenticates the user, and the frontend redirects to the dashboard.

### 5.2 API and Database Integration
- **Test Case ID**: TC_INTEGRATION_002
- **Test Scenario**: Verify that user data entered in the registration form is correctly stored in the database.
- **Preconditions**: User provides valid registration information.
- **Test Steps**:
  1. Open the registration page.
  2. Enter user details (name, email, password).
  3. Submit the form.
- **Expected Results**: User data is saved in the database, and a confirmation message is shown.

## 6. Tools and Environment
- **Testing Tools**: The following tools will be used to conduct the tests:
  - Selenium for automated functional testing.
  - JMeter for performance and load testing.
  - OWASP ZAP for security testing.
- **Test Environment**: Tests will be executed in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment.

## 7. Metrics for Success
Success for test case execution will be measured by:
- Meeting the functional requirements without critical issues.
- Achieving performance benchmarks (e.g., response times under 2 seconds for key actions).
- Passing security tests without any vulnerabilities detected.

## 8. Conclusion
This document provides an overview of functional and non-functional test cases, as well as integration tests, ensuring that the system operates as expected under various scenarios. By covering a wide range of test cases, the QA team can validate that the system is ready for deployment and meets both business and technical requirements.
