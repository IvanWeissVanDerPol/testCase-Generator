# Requirement Traceability Matrix Input

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to map the project requirements to corresponding test cases. This ensures that all requirements are covered by test cases and that there is full traceability from requirements to testing. It helps the QA team verify that all functional and non-functional requirements are met by the developed system.

## 2. Requirement Traceability Table

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description                                 | Test Case ID(s)                 | Test Type          | Status   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|----------|
| REQ-001        | The system must allow users to register an account.      | TC_FUNC_001, TC_FUNC_002        | Functional Testing | Pending  |
| REQ-002        | The system must allow users to log in using their credentials. | TC_FUNC_003, TC_FUNC_004        | Functional Testing | Pending  |

| REQ-005        | The system must log failed login attempts.               | TC_FUNC_008                     | Functional Testing | Pending  |
| REQ-006        | The system must ensure password strength validation.     | TC_FUNC_009, TC_FUNC_010        | Functional Testing | Pending  |
| REQ-007        | The system must prevent brute-force attacks.             | TC_SECURITY_001, TC_SECURITY_002 | Security Testing   | Pending  |
| REQ-008        | The system should maintain response times under 2 seconds for login requests. | TC_PERF_001                     | Performance Testing | Pending  |
| REQ-009        | The system must be scalable to handle up to 100,000 concurrent users. | TC_SCALABILITY_001              | Scalability Testing | Pending  |
| REQ-010        | The system should support both desktop and mobile interfaces. | TC_FUNC_011, TC_FUNC_012        | Functional Testing | Pending  |
| REQ-011        | The system must provide secure storage for user data.    | TC_SECURITY_003                 | Security Testing   | Pending  |

## 3. Test Coverage Analysis
Each requirement is linked to at least one or more test cases. This ensures that:
- **Full coverage**: All project requirements are validated through testing.
- **Traceability**: Any changes or updates to requirements can easily be traced back to the corresponding test cases.
- **Completion Tracking**: Test case execution status is regularly updated to track progress against each requirement.

## 4. Key Test Case Definitions
### Functional Testing
- **TC_FUNC_001**: Validates that the user registration form is accessible and inputs are correctly validated.
- **TC_FUNC_002**: Confirms that user account creation is successful with valid data.
- **TC_FUNC_003**: Ensures that users can log in with valid credentials.
- **TC_FUNC_004**: Verifies that incorrect credentials result in appropriate error messages.
- **TC_FUNC_005**: Checks that the system sends a validation email upon user registration.

### Security Testing
- **TC_SECURITY_001**: Tests the system's response to multiple failed login attempts to ensure brute-force protection.
- **TC_SECURITY_002**: Confirms that the system logs unauthorized login attempts.
- **TC_SECURITY_003**: Ensures secure encryption of user data in storage.

### Performance and Scalability Testing
- **TC_PERF_001**: Measures the system's response time for login requests under high traffic.
- **TC_SCALABILITY_001**: Validates that the system can handle the required number of concurrent users without performance degradation.

## 5. Conclusion
The Requirement Traceability Matrix provides a clear and structured overview of how project requirements are tied to test cases. This document will be continuously updated as more requirements and test cases are added or modified during the project lifecycle.
