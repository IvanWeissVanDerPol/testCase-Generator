# User Validation System Procedures

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the procedures for validating the user system within the project. The focus is on ensuring that users are authenticated, registered, and validated properly across all features.

## 2. User Validation Overview
User validation is critical to ensuring that only authorized users can access the system. The procedures cover the following:
- **Registration Validation**: Ensuring new users provide valid inputs during the registration process.
- **Login Validation**: Confirming that users can log in using valid credentials and that invalid login attempts are handled correctly.
- **Session Management**: Ensuring that user sessions are created, maintained, and destroyed securely.
- **Password Recovery Validation**: Ensuring the password recovery process is secure and functional.

## 3. Registration Validation Procedure
### 3.1 Inputs
- **User Information**: The system must validate that all required fields (e.g., email, password, name) are entered correctly.
- **Field Constraints**: Email must be in the correct format (e.g., example@domain.com), and the password must meet strength requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).

### 3.2 Validation Steps
1. Ensure that the user provides all required fields.
2. Validate the email format using regular expressions.
3. Check password strength:
   - Minimum of 8 characters
   - At least one uppercase letter
   - At least one number
   - At least one special character
4. Validate that the email is not already associated with an existing account.
5. Confirm user account creation and send a verification email.

## 4. Login Validation Procedure
### 4.1 Inputs
- **User Credentials**: Users must enter their email and password for login.

### 4.2 Validation Steps
1. Ensure that the email is registered in the system.
2. Validate that the password matches the stored hash for the user's email.
3. If login fails more than 3 times, temporarily lock the user’s account and notify them.
4. Generate a user session on successful login.
5. Redirect the user to their dashboard or homepage.

## 5. Session Management Procedure
### 5.1 Session Creation
- Upon successful login, a user session should be created and associated with a unique session token.
- The token should be stored securely in both the client and server.

### 5.2 Session Maintenance
- Ensure that the session remains active for the user's entire session duration.
- Implement session expiration after a predefined period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes).

### 5.3 Session Termination
- Users should be able to log out manually from the system, which should terminate the session.
- The session should be automatically terminated if the system detects suspicious activity or if the user reaches the session timeout limit.

## 6. Password Recovery Validation Procedure
### 6.1 Inputs
- **User Email**: The email associated with the user’s account must be provided for password recovery.

### 6.2 Validation Steps
1. Verify that the provided email exists in the system.
2. Send a secure password reset link to the user's email.
3. Ensure the reset link expires after a defined time (e.g., 24 hours).
4. Validate the new password using the same constraints as registration.
5. Update the user's password in the database after successful validation.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Consider implementing MFA to increase login security.
- **CAPTCHA**: Implement CAPTCHA during registration and login to prevent automated attacks.

## 8. Audit and Monitoring
- All user validation activities (registration, login, password recovery) should be logged for auditing purposes.
- Monitor the system for unusual login activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or suspicious session behaviors.

## 9. Error Handling
### 9.1 Registration Errors
- Missing or invalid input should trigger a clear error message explaining the issue to the user (e.g., "Please provide a valid email").

### 9.2 Login Errors
- Incorrect password attempts should display a message (e.g., "Incorrect password. Please try again.").
- Multiple failed login attempts should lock the account for a temporary period.

### 9.3 Password Recovery Errors
- If the provided email is not associated with an account, display a non-descriptive error to prevent malicious users from identifying valid emails.

## 10. Testing Procedures
The following tests should be performed to validate the user system:
- **Functional Testing**: Test registration, login, session management, and password recovery workflows.
- **Security Testing**: Check for vulnerabilities like SQL injection or brute-force login attempts.
- **Usability Testing**: Ensure the error messages and flows are user-friendly.
- **Performance Testing**: Validate the system's ability to handle multiple concurrent logins and registrations.

## 11. Conclusion
The procedures outlined here provide a comprehensive approach to validating users within the system. By ensuring robust registration, login, session management, and password recovery mechanisms, we can protect user data and maintain system integrity.
