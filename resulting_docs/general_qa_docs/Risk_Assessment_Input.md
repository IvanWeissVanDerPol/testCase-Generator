## Risk Monitoring & Reporting:
- **Weekly Risk Reviews**: Regular risk reviews will be conducted to assess the status of identified risks and to introduce new risks as the project evolves.
- **Risk Reports**: A risk dashboard will be maintained in **JIRA** to track the severity, likelihood, and mitigation status of each identified risk.
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Key risks and mitigation efforts will be reported to stakeholders during weekly project meetings.

## Continuous Improvement:
- The risk management process will be evaluated after each sprint to identify areas for improvement and to ensure that risks are managed efficiently throughout the project lifecycle.
