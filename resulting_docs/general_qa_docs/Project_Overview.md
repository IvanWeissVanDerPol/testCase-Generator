# Project Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the project, outlining its objectives, key modules, stakeholders, and the scope of the QA automation effort.

## Project Name:
- **QA Automation Test Suite**

## Objective:
- The primary objective of this project is to ensure that the system adheres to its **functional** and **non-functional** requirements through rigorous and automated testing. This will help validate the stability, performance, security, and usability of the application across various environments.

## Scope:
- **Functional Testing**: Validate that all features and functionalities behave as expected according to the business requirements.
- **Non-Functional Testing**: Evaluate system performance, security, and usability under various conditions, including load and stress testing.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs as expected after code or environment changes.
- **Integration Testing**: Validate that different modules and components of the system work seamlessly together.

## Key Deliverables:

1. **Automated Test Suite**: 
   - Functional and non-functional test cases automated using tools like Selenium, JMeter, and LoadRunner.
   
2. **Test Plan**:
   - A comprehensive test plan detailing the testing strategy, tools, and timelines for test execution.

3. **Test Reports**:
   - Weekly reports summarizing test execution results, defects found, and key performance metrics.

4. **Defect Management**:
   - Defects logged and tracked in JIRA, with reports generated for stakeholders on defect severity and status.

5. **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**:
   - A document linking test cases to business requirements to ensure full coverage and validation.

## Test Environment:

- **Operating System**: 
  - Windows 10, macOS 12.x
- **Browser**: 
  - Chrome (latest version), Firefox (latest version), Safari (latest version for macOS)
- **Database**: 
  - MySQL (version 8.x)
- **Automation Tools**: 
  - **Selenium** for functional test automation.
  - **JMeter** for performance testing.
  - **LoadRunner** for stress testing.

## Risks and Mitigations:

| **Risk**                                        | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                                                      |
