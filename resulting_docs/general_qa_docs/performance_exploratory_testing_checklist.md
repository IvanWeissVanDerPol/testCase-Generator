## Defect Tracking & Reporting:

- Any defects or unexpected behavior encountered during performance or exploratory testing will be logged into **JIRA**.
- Each defect will be reviewed, prioritized, and assigned for resolution based on its impact and criticality.

## Test Environment:

- **Operating System**: Windows 10, macOS 12.x
- **Browser**: Chrome (latest version), Firefox (latest version), Safari (latest version for macOS)
- **Database**: MySQL (version 8.x)
- **Network**: Simulated high-speed and low-bandwidth environments for testing.

## Continuous Improvement:

- After each testing cycle, a review will be conducted to improve the testing process, identify key performance bottlenecks, and enhance the exploratory testing approach.
- Lessons learned will be incorporated into future testing cycles, with an emphasis on preventing recurring issues and enhancing overall system performance.
