# System Architecture Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy based on the system's architecture to ensure comprehensive validation across all components and interactions. It details the testing levels, environments, and responsibilities for successful QA execution.

## Testing Levels

| **Testing Level**   | **Objective**                                      | **Responsibility**        | **Tools**                        | **Description**                                                                                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Testing**     | Verify individual components and their behavior.   | Developers                 | JUnit, PyTest                    | Unit tests ensure that each module, function, or class performs as expected. Focus is on internal logic.  |
| **Integration Testing** | Test the interaction between integrated components. | QA                         | Postman, Selenium                | Integration tests validate data flow and communication between modules or services, ensuring they work together. |
| **System Testing**   | Validate the entire system's functionality.        | QA                         | Selenium, JMeter                 | System tests cover end-to-end testing of the complete system, verifying that all features work as a whole. |

### 1. **Unit Testing**:
   - **Responsibility**: Developers
   - **Objective**: Ensure that individual components (e.g., functions, classes) function correctly in isolation.
   - **Tools**: 
     - **JUnit** for Java-based unit testing.
     - **PyTest** for Python-based unit testing.
   - **Key Focus Areas**:
     - Functionality of individual methods and classes.
     - Error handling and boundary conditions.

### 2. **Integration Testing**:
   - **Responsibility**: QA
   - **Objective**: Test the interactions between integrated modules to ensure data exchange is seamless.
   - **Tools**:
     - **Postman** for testing API interactions between components.
     - **Selenium** for validating UI component integration.
   - **Key Focus Areas**:
     - Communication between APIs.
     - Interaction between UI and back-end services.
     - Database transactions and data integrity.

### 3. **System Testing**:
   - **Responsibility**: QA
   - **Objective**: Validate the entire system's functionality and performance, covering both functional and non-functional requirements.
   - **Tools**:
     - **Selenium** for end-to-end functional testing of the user interface.
     - **JMeter** for performance testing under various user loads.
   - **Key Focus Areas**:
     - Full system functionality.
     - Performance under normal and peak load conditions.
     - System behavior in both typical and edge cases.

## Testing Environments

| **Environment**        | **Purpose**                                      | **Key Activities**                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Development Environment** | Primarily used for unit testing.                   | Developers test individual modules and components in isolation. |
| **Staging Environment** | Used for integration and system testing.         | QA tests integrated components and the entire system in a production-like environment. |

### 1. **Development Environment**:
   - **Purpose**: Used exclusively for unit testing.
   - **Tools**: Local development tools like **JUnit** and **PyTest**.
   - **Setup**: Each developer tests individual code components in their local environment to validate functionality before committing to the shared repository.
   
### 2. **Staging Environment**:
   - **Purpose**: Used for integration and system testing.
   - **Tools**: **Postman**, **Selenium**, and **JMeter**.
   - **Setup**: A pre-production environment simulating the production setup, where the entire system is deployed and tested for functionality, performance, and integration between modules.

## Key Testing Strategy Points

- **Automated Testing**: 
  - Unit and integration tests should be automated where possible to allow for continuous integration (CI) and faster feedback cycles.
  - **CI/CD Integration**: Automated tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early in development.
  
- **Regression Testing**: 
  - For every system or integration change, run automated regression tests to ensure no unintended functionality has been affected.

- **Performance Testing**:
  - Use **JMeter** for performance testing in the staging environment to validate the system's response under load.
  
- **Security Testing**:
  - Ensure security features like session management, authentication, and encryption are tested during system testing.

## Testing Approach and Coverage

- **Test Coverage**:
  - Ensure that all components, including edge cases, are tested at the unit level.
  - Integration testing will cover all critical paths between modules.
  - System testing will validate the complete system, focusing on end-to-end functionality and performance.

- **Test Case Prioritization**:
  - Critical system features such as user login, payment gateway, and data integrity should be prioritized in system and integration testing.
  - Performance tests should focus on high-traffic areas like the dashboard and payment systems.

## Reporting & Metrics

- **Test Results**:
  - Unit test results are reported automatically during the development process using CI tools.
  - Integration and system test results are logged in **JIRA** and presented in test execution reports.
  
- **Metrics**:
  - **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by unit, integration, and system tests.
  - **Pass/Fail Rates**: For each testing level, track the number of passed and failed test cases.
  - **Defect Rate**: Monitor the number of defects identified during each phase of testing.
