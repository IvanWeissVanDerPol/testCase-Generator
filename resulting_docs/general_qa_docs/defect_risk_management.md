# Defect Risk Management

This document outlines the strategy for managing defects and associated risks throughout the QA process for the project.

## Defect Tracking Process:

1. **Identify Defects**:
   - Defects are gathered from various testing phases, including functional, integration, and non-functional testing.
   - Each defect is logged with detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, test environment, expected vs. actual results, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
   - All defects are reviewed to ensure they are accurately documented and verified before assigning for resolution.

2. **Prioritize Defects**:
   - Defects are classified based on **severity** (impact on the system) and **priority** (importance for fixing in the current release).
   - Severity levels:
     - **Critical**: Prevents functionality or causes a system crash.
     - **Major**: Significant impact but with a possible workaround.
     - **Minor**: Small impact, but the system can function normally.
     - **Trivial**: Cosmetic issues or minor bugs.
   - Priority levels:
     - **P1**: Must be fixed immediately for the current release.
     - **P2**: Should be fixed but not a blocker for the release.
     - **P3**: Can be fixed in future releases.
   - Defect prioritization is revisited during regular risk assessments to ensure the most critical issues are addressed.

3. **Assign and Resolve**:
   - Defects are assigned to the relevant developers or team members based on expertise and workload.
   - The status of each defect is tracked through various stages:
     - **New**: Defect identified and logged.
     - **In Progress**: Assigned for resolution.
     - **Resolved**: Fix applied, pending retesting.
     - **Reopened**: Re-tested but not resolved.
     - **Closed**: Successfully resolved and verified.
   - Resolutions are tracked within the test management tools, and associated test cases are re-executed to validate the fix.

4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Risks associated with unresolved or critical defects are continuously assessed during risk management meetings.
   - **Mitigation Strategies**:
     - **Workarounds**: Identify temporary solutions for defects that cannot be resolved immediately.
     - **Regression Testing**: Ensure that fixes do not introduce new issues by running a comprehensive set of regression tests.
     - **Fallback Planning**: In cases where a fix cannot be implemented in time, evaluate whether rolling back features or releases is a viable option.
   - High-risk defects (e.g., those impacting major functionalities or critical systems) are prioritized for immediate attention, and mitigation plans are communicated to stakeholders.

5. **Risk Monitoring**:
   - Regular risk reviews are conducted to monitor defects with significant impact on the project schedule or product quality.
   - Metrics such as defect density, defect aging, and open defect counts are analyzed to inform decision-making and risk adjustments.
   - Critical defects are discussed in daily standups to track progress and resolution timelines.

## Tools Used:

- **JIRA**: For defect logging, tracking, prioritization, and reporting.
- **Confluence**: For documenting defect mitigation strategies and providing historical tracking of resolved risks.
- **Slack**: For team collaboration and real-time communication about critical or high-risk defects.
- **TestRail**: For managing test case execution, linking defects to specific test cases for easier retesting and verification.

## Reporting:

- Weekly reports are generated to highlight open defects, their current statuses, and risk levels.
- Reports are distributed to stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and QA leads, to ensure transparency and prompt attention to high-risk areas.

## Continuous Improvement:

- Regular post-release reviews are conducted to identify root causes of major defects and evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies.
- Lessons learned are incorporated into future testing cycles to improve defect management practices and reduce project risks over time.
