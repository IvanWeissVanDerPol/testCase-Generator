# user_validation_system_procedures.md

# User Validation System Procedures

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the procedures for validating the user system within the project. The focus is on ensuring that users are authenticated, registered, and validated properly across all features.

## 2. User Validation Overview
User validation is critical to ensuring that only authorized users can access the system. The procedures cover the following:
- **Registration Validation**: Ensuring new users provide valid inputs during the registration process.
- **Login Validation**: Confirming that users can log in using valid credentials and that invalid login attempts are handled correctly.
- **Session Management**: Ensuring that user sessions are created, maintained, and destroyed securely.
- **Password Recovery Validation**: Ensuring the password recovery process is secure and functional.

## 3. Registration Validation Procedure
### 3.1 Inputs
- **User Information**: The system must validate that all required fields (e.g., email, password, name) are entered correctly.
- **Field Constraints**: Email must be in the correct format (e.g., example@domain.com), and the password must meet strength requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).

### 3.2 Validation Steps
1. Ensure that the user provides all required fields.
2. Validate the email format using regular expressions.
3. Check password strength:
   - Minimum of 8 characters
   - At least one uppercase letter
   - At least one number
   - At least one special character
4. Validate that the email is not already associated with an existing account.
5. Confirm user account creation and send a verification email.

## 4. Login Validation Procedure
### 4.1 Inputs
- **User Credentials**: Users must enter their email and password for login.

### 4.2 Validation Steps
1. Ensure that the email is registered in the system.
2. Validate that the password matches the stored hash for the user's email.
3. If login fails more than 3 times, temporarily lock the user’s account and notify them.
4. Generate a user session on successful login.
5. Redirect the user to their dashboard or homepage.

## 5. Session Management Procedure
### 5.1 Session Creation
- Upon successful login, a user session should be created and associated with a unique session token.
- The token should be stored securely in both the client and server.

### 5.2 Session Maintenance
- Ensure that the session remains active for the user's entire session duration.
- Implement session expiration after a predefined period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes).

### 5.3 Session Termination
- Users should be able to log out manually from the system, which should terminate the session.
- The session should be automatically terminated if the system detects suspicious activity or if the user reaches the session timeout limit.

## 6. Password Recovery Validation Procedure
### 6.1 Inputs
- **User Email**: The email associated with the user’s account must be provided for password recovery.

### 6.2 Validation Steps
1. Verify that the provided email exists in the system.
2. Send a secure password reset link to the user's email.
3. Ensure the reset link expires after a defined time (e.g., 24 hours).
4. Validate the new password using the same constraints as registration.
5. Update the user's password in the database after successful validation.

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Consider implementing MFA to increase login security.
- **CAPTCHA**: Implement CAPTCHA during registration and login to prevent automated attacks.

## 8. Audit and Monitoring
- All user validation activities (registration, login, password recovery) should be logged for auditing purposes.
- Monitor the system for unusual login activities, such as multiple failed login attempts or suspicious session behaviors.

## 9. Error Handling
### 9.1 Registration Errors
- Missing or invalid input should trigger a clear error message explaining the issue to the user (e.g., "Please provide a valid email").

### 9.2 Login Errors
- Incorrect password attempts should display a message (e.g., "Incorrect password. Please try again.").
- Multiple failed login attempts should lock the account for a temporary period.

### 9.3 Password Recovery Errors
- If the provided email is not associated with an account, display a non-descriptive error to prevent malicious users from identifying valid emails.

## 10. Testing Procedures
The following tests should be performed to validate the user system:
- **Functional Testing**: Test registration, login, session management, and password recovery workflows.
- **Security Testing**: Check for vulnerabilities like SQL injection or brute-force login attempts.
- **Usability Testing**: Ensure the error messages and flows are user-friendly.
- **Performance Testing**: Validate the system's ability to handle multiple concurrent logins and registrations.

## 11. Conclusion
The procedures outlined here provide a comprehensive approach to validating users within the system. By ensuring robust registration, login, session management, and password recovery mechanisms, we can protect user data and maintain system integrity.



# defect_risk_management.md

# Defect Risk Management

This document outlines the strategy for managing defects and associated risks throughout the QA process for the project.

## Defect Tracking Process:

1. **Identify Defects**:
   - Defects are gathered from various testing phases, including functional, integration, and non-functional testing.
   - Each defect is logged with detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, test environment, expected vs. actual results, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
   - All defects are reviewed to ensure they are accurately documented and verified before assigning for resolution.

2. **Prioritize Defects**:
   - Defects are classified based on **severity** (impact on the system) and **priority** (importance for fixing in the current release).
   - Severity levels:
     - **Critical**: Prevents functionality or causes a system crash.
     - **Major**: Significant impact but with a possible workaround.
     - **Minor**: Small impact, but the system can function normally.
     - **Trivial**: Cosmetic issues or minor bugs.
   - Priority levels:
     - **P1**: Must be fixed immediately for the current release.
     - **P2**: Should be fixed but not a blocker for the release.
     - **P3**: Can be fixed in future releases.
   - Defect prioritization is revisited during regular risk assessments to ensure the most critical issues are addressed.

3. **Assign and Resolve**:
   - Defects are assigned to the relevant developers or team members based on expertise and workload.
   - The status of each defect is tracked through various stages:
     - **New**: Defect identified and logged.
     - **In Progress**: Assigned for resolution.
     - **Resolved**: Fix applied, pending retesting.
     - **Reopened**: Re-tested but not resolved.
     - **Closed**: Successfully resolved and verified.
   - Resolutions are tracked within the test management tools, and associated test cases are re-executed to validate the fix.

4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Risks associated with unresolved or critical defects are continuously assessed during risk management meetings.
   - **Mitigation Strategies**:
     - **Workarounds**: Identify temporary solutions for defects that cannot be resolved immediately.
     - **Regression Testing**: Ensure that fixes do not introduce new issues by running a comprehensive set of regression tests.
     - **Fallback Planning**: In cases where a fix cannot be implemented in time, evaluate whether rolling back features or releases is a viable option.
   - High-risk defects (e.g., those impacting major functionalities or critical systems) are prioritized for immediate attention, and mitigation plans are communicated to stakeholders.

5. **Risk Monitoring**:
   - Regular risk reviews are conducted to monitor defects with significant impact on the project schedule or product quality.
   - Metrics such as defect density, defect aging, and open defect counts are analyzed to inform decision-making and risk adjustments.
   - Critical defects are discussed in daily standups to track progress and resolution timelines.

## Tools Used:

- **JIRA**: For defect logging, tracking, prioritization, and reporting.
- **Confluence**: For documenting defect mitigation strategies and providing historical tracking of resolved risks.
- **Slack**: For team collaboration and real-time communication about critical or high-risk defects.
- **TestRail**: For managing test case execution, linking defects to specific test cases for easier retesting and verification.

## Reporting:

- Weekly reports are generated to highlight open defects, their current statuses, and risk levels.
- Reports are distributed to stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and QA leads, to ensure transparency and prompt attention to high-risk areas.

## Continuous Improvement:

- Regular post-release reviews are conducted to identify root causes of major defects and evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies.
- Lessons learned are incorporated into future testing cycles to improve defect management practices and reduce project risks over time.
