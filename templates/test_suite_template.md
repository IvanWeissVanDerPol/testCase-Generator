#### **Test Cases Included:**

| **Test Case ID** | **Description**                                   | **Priority** | **Status**       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|
| TC_WEB_FUNC_001  | Verify successful login with valid credentials    | High         | Not executed     |
| TC_APP_FUNC_002  | Validate push notification functionality          | High         | Not executed     |
| TC_WEB_FUNC_003  | Verify transaction processing flow                | Medium       | In progress      |
| TC_APP_FUNC_004  | Test biometric login functionality on mobile      | Medium       | Not executed     |

#### **Prerequisites:**
[Prerequisites to be met before test execution]  
*Example*:  
1. Users must have valid test accounts in both the web and mobile applications.  
2. The application must be accessible in the staging environment.  
3. Required test data such as transaction details, test credit cards, or mock user data must be available.  
4. Devices must be set up with biometric capabilities enabled (if applicable).

#### **Test Environment:**
[Details of the test environment used for execution]  
*Example*:  
- **Environment**: Staging  
- **Web Browsers**: Chrome (latest), Safari (latest), Firefox (latest)  
- **Devices**: iPhone 13 (iOS 15), Google Pixel 6 (Android 12)  
- **Operating Systems**: Windows 11, macOS Monterey  
- **Database**: MySQL (v8.x)  
- **Network**: Stable internet connection (Wi-Fi 50Mbps)

#### **Execution Steps:**
1. Set up and verify the availability of the staging environment.
2. Ensure that all test accounts and test data are correctly configured.
3. Execute the test cases listed above, following the steps outlined in each test case.
4. Log any defects encountered during testing into the defect management tool.
5. Record the results of each test case in the **Test Results** section below.

#### **Pass/Fail Criteria:**
[Define clear pass/fail criteria for the test suite]  
*Example*:  
- **Pass**: All critical/high-priority test cases must pass without any major defects, and medium-priority cases can have minor issues if they do not impact core functionality.  
- **Fail**: Any failure of a high-priority test case or the presence of a critical defect will result in the failure of the test suite.

#### **Test Results:**

| **Test Case ID**  | **Result**  | **Defect ID** | **Notes**                               |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| TC_WEB_FUNC_001   | Pass        | N/A          | Login functionality verified            |
| TC_APP_FUNC_002   | Fail        | DEF_002      | Notification delays on Android devices  |
| TC_WEB_FUNC_003   | Pass        | N/A          | Transaction flow completed successfully |
| TC_APP_FUNC_004   | Pending     | N/A          | Test not yet executed                   |

#### **Test Dependencies:**
[Outline any dependencies that may impact the test suiteâ€™s execution]  
*Example*:  
- Dependency on third-party payment gateways for transaction processing tests.  
- Integration with external notification services for mobile notifications.  
- Availability of biometric devices for testing login functionality on mobile apps.

#### **Tested By:**
[Name of the tester executing the suite]  
*Example*: `Jane Doe`

#### **Date of Execution:**
[Date when the test suite was executed]  
*Example*: `2024-09-16`

#### **Defect Tracking:**
[Provide a summary of how defects are tracked and managed]  
*Example*: Defects found during testing are logged in **JIRA**, categorized by severity, and assigned to relevant team members for resolution.

#### **Test Metrics:**
[Metrics that track the success or failure of the suite]  
*Example*:  
- **Test Case Execution Rate**: % of executed test cases vs. planned cases.  
- **Pass Rate**: % of test cases that passed.  
- **Defect Density**: Number of defects found per module or feature.

#### **Conclusion:**
